            <p>SELECTING BIRD TOYS: Choose only toys sold by reputable companies. We inspect any new toys very carefully
                to try and determine how safe they are before we agree to sell them. We use our own experiences and those

            <h3 class="author">By Shari Beaudoin</h3>
            <p>Lt. Columbo, my male Double Yellow-headed Amazon, Amazona ochrocephala oratrix, is the perfect myth buster
                when it comes to discussions regarding unmanageable, sexually mature, male Amazons or what I call "THE
                USMMA". Many people are of the belief that all or most sexually mature male Amazon parrots...</p>

            <h3 class="author">By Terry Beaudoin</h3>
            <p>A better question for us to ask might be: What is in the air our companion birds breathe once they are
                living in our homes? The understanding of companion birds specific physiological needs and the affect
